Front-End Website and WordPress Developer

I am seeking an apprenticeship or entry level role that focuses on front-end development with JavaScript, but is open to developing further full-stack capabilities.
Growing and learning from others is tantamount to my desire to produce quality and detailed work that meets the standards set and used by the team.  Working well with others is my forte’, but I am quite self-driven as well.  
Feeling productive and contributing to a project with like-minded people who can communicate well is what I desire. It’s the people, not the technology or tools, that have mattered most for project success.
